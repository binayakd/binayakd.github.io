Hi! I am Binayak Dasgupta, currently working as a lead software developer in Standard Chartered Bank Singapore. My tech career started after completed my PhD in Material Science, in 2017, which I swiftly abandoned to take an entry level position as in tech. 

I went from test automation engineer, to Java developer, to DevOps, to finally Lead Developer working on software development, DevOps and data engineering projects, working with mostly Java and Python. 

This blog is where I will ramble about some interesting tech challenges and situations that I have encountered, and my attempt to solving them. This blog will also be a place where I experiment, and try out stuff, so if stuff breaks, please bear with me. 

You can reach out to me though [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dasguptabinayak/) or email: `binayakd86 at gmail dot com`
